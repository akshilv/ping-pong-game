# Ping Pong Game
This is my first attempt at writing a browser based game using `html canvas` and `javascript`.

## Run the game
- Clone the repo
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/akshilv/ping-pong-game.git
    ```

- Open `index.html` in any browser

Note: To change any of the default settings, change the global variables in `gameController.js`.

## How to play

- Hover the mouse to move the left paddle.
- Position the paddle properly to hit the ball.
- Increase or decrease the speed of the ball based on the part of the paddle that hits the ball.
- First to reach 3 points wins.
- Left click to restart the game after the game gets over.
